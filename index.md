### Credit Card Fraud Detection

Fraud is a costly part of the credit card industry. In fact, in 2022, the Nilson Report, a major publication which provides data for the banking industry, forecaset that the U.S. should expect a total loss of  $165.1 billion over the next 10 years due to fraudulent charges.

Bank ABC wants to improve its ability to recognize if a transaction is fraudulent. As a data scientist, I was tasked with finding a trackable
approach to improving the current process in place. 

My goal is to find a robust algorithm that can identify suspicious transactions and minimize expense to the company. 

### Solving the problem

This problem will be approached using several supervised learning algorithms. Because a small number of transactions are fraudulent (only 0.17% of the transactions), it would be quite reasonable to just assume that all are legitimate from a probabilistic point of view, but it is costly to work from such a position. Instead, the more conservative route would be to best predict transactions that are suspicious without impacting most transactions. Ideally, the process of identification would capture as many truly fraudulent transactions while minimizing those which are falsely marked as fraudulent. 

### Metrics Used for Evaluation

<center> **Confusion Matrix ** </center>
  
|                 | Predicted Negative | Predicted Positive   |
|-----------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| Actual Negative | True Negative (TN)  | False Positive (FP) |
| Actual Positive | False Negative (FN) | True Positive (TP)  |

  
  In a confusion matrix, the predicted values are listed in the columns, and the actual values are listed in the rows. The four main components of a confusion matrix are:

-True Negative (TN): The number of correctly predicted negative instances.\
-False Positive (FP): The number of incorrectly predicted positive instances.\
-False Negative (FN): The number of incorrectly predicted negative instances.\
-True Positive (TP): The number of correctly predicted positive instances.
  
  
The confusion matrix is a valuable tool for evaluating the performance of classification models. It provides a clear representation of the relationship between predicted and actual values, enabling the calculation of various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
  
**Model Accuracy**
  
$$\text{Accuracy} = \frac{TN+TP}{N}$$
    where $N$ is the sample size 
  
**Model Precision**
$$Â \text{Precision} =\frac{TN}{TN+ FP}$$
The precision of the model is also known as the positive predictive value of the model. It represents the proportion of positive values that were correctly predicted. 

## The Data
The datasest was made up of 284,807 rows of data with 31 columns. These data were credit card transactions, and the column names were labeled as V1, V2, \ldots, V28, amount and class. The class column is a represents whether or not the purchase was fraudulent--1 for fraudulent, 0 for non-fraudulent.


 
## Classification Models Explored  

### Logistic Regression Model
### Decision Tree Model
### Random Forest Model
I also applied PCA to see if

In this case study from Data Analytics Accelerator, I was prompted to analyze the State of Massachusetts education data. The main focuses were:
What schools are struggling the most?
How does class size affect college admission?
What are the top math schools in the state?
