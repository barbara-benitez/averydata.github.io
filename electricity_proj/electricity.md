 # Problem
 ## Pricing Electricity: Challenge and Strategy
 
Predicting the price of electricity is a multifaceted problem that influenced by a myriad of physical and economic factors. 
The challenge I have been given is to forecast the price of electricity for a company, given a dataset including 16 
factors and the historical price of electricity for over 38,000 instances.

I am free to select any modeling algorithm to make the forecasts, but I need to justify the final model that I select to make predictions. 

In the exploration, I explored four supervised machine learning algorithms: linear regression, linear regression with VIF applied, support vector machines, and 
gradient boost regression. Support vector machines and gradient boost gave similarly precise models. I would recommend the gradient 
booster regression model over the support vector machines as it is not as demanding of computational resources.
