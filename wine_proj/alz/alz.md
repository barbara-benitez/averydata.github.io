# How well can we predict Alzeimer's disease?

## According to the Alzheimer's Association, as of 2023, the health and long-term cost of people living with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias are projected to be $345 billion dollars. 

My goal with this project was to examine several factors that are tracked as factors that influence the development of Alzheimer's disease. This is a disease that I know and understand due to personal experience. Any insights that can help us understand how to detect accurately Alzheimer's can result in additional years of quality of life for those affected by the disease.
